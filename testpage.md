During my undergrad years, I served for 8 semesters as a teaching assistant for
[CS 61A](http://cs61a.org), UC Berkeley's introductory computer science course.
This page contains practice problems and notes that I wrote to help students.

## Practice problems

> These practice problems are written and organized to reflect the topics from
> [Summer 2015](http://su15.cs61a.org), the last semester that I was involved
> with 61A.  Most of the content is the same, but there may be a few differences
> between Summer 2015 and the current semester.
