# Network Security

Networks are beautiful. You've got a network of people you know closely and talk to often. 
Well, computers have networks too!
A network is what allows us to send snaps, share documents, and send huge amounts of information nearly instantaneously
to others. 
Alas, with all good things come bad: computer networks also open up our machines to attackers. 

*Network security* is quite a broad term, and can refer to a number of different things. 
Historically, only system administrators cared about this sort of thing. 
Now, however, networks are becoming pretty much ubiquitous, so developers should know about this stuff too.
