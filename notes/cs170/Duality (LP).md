# Duality (LP)

We have seen that in networks the max flow and min cut exactly coincide and prove each other's optimality. 

It turns out that every linear maximization problem has a **dual** minimization problem. 

To understand what duality is about, recall this LP:

$\max x_1 + 6x_2$ 

x1 ≤ 200 

x2 ≤ 300 

x1 + x2 ≤ 400 

x1, x2 ≥ 0
